## Welcome to the Professional ReadMe Generator

ReadMe Generator is created to act as a resource for everyone to be able to quickly and easily generate a ReadMe to their liking for a new project! The generator starts off by asking the name of the ReadMe, and continues to ask various questions afterwards. These include a description, information on how to use the application, details on how to install the application, licensing type, details on the contributions, details on running tests, and lastly, a github username along with an email for contacting purposes. Many of these questions are required, so they cannot be skipped or will state the same question again until it is answered. Upon entering all of the details, a professional ReadMe will be generated!
